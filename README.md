## Notes

The opening study must be comprehensive and as deep as possible.

## About

There is a lichess bot (@openingsexercise) that plays lines from a lichess study. Study opening lines with the bot, and you can see your statistics on this site.

1. Pickup an opening book and make a lichess study of important lines.
2a. Login this site via lichess.
2. Paste the study link into the form below. It will import the study into this site.
3. Challenge the bot and paste the chapter link to game chat in lichess.
4. Play as many games as you like by offering a rematch. Make sure to play both as white and black.
5. Come back to this website and click Refresh Games to analyze your recently played games with the bot.
6. See your progress for each opening move. For each move, statistics is number of (The move made / The position reached) 

Bot will pick a variation randomly, so play more games to cover every variation. Try to keep your stats at green by reaching the positions close to 10 times.

7. Consider sharing your studies with fellow friends or @chesteditor to feature them on this site.

This project is currently under development, openings may be deleted or crash. Please consider giving feedback by messaging @chesteditor on lichess.
